# Slack Installer Script
A quick and easy Shell Script to install Slack for easy remote deployment

The script grabs the most recent available slack version via the official website, mounts the image, copies the relevant files, and cleans up. 

Handy if you are working remotely currently due to Covid, and need to deploy Slack to new users! 

Note: I haven't tested this with jamf, but works with Fleetsmith!
